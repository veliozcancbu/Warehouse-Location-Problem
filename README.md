There are N = 0...n-1 warehouses that can be selected and M = 0...m-1 customers that need to be served.
Each warehouse has a capacity (capw) and an installation cost (Sw).
Each customer has a demand capacity (dc) depending on the warehouse they are served by and a travel cost (tcw).
Finally, each customer should be served by only one warehouse. aw represents an array of variables indicating the customers assigned to warehouse w.
